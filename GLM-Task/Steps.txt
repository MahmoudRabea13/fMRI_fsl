Then:

	open fsl using fsl command in your terminal then choose FEAT fMRI analysis
	In the data tab:

		                Check on Add Temporal derivative & Uncheck on Apply Temporal Filtering
	  - Repeat the previous step for 2 but replace incongruent with congruent
	  - Go to Contrast&F-Tests: Contrasts -> 3
		                    OC1 -> incongruent [1,0]
		                    OC2 -> congruent [0,1]
		                    OC3 -> incongruent-congruent [1,-1]
		                    CLICK Done
