# Steps to do 1st Level Analysis for all your 26 FLANKER Dataset subjects

At first , you will ned to create a design template that will be applied to all the subjects.
assuming that you haven't manually done GLM or Preprocessing , kindly follow these steps:

	1) you need to place Make_FSL_Timings.sh in your Data folder and run it using bash command in your terminal 
	2) Open fsl using fsl command in your terminal then choose FEAT fMRI analysis 
	3) Do the following for 1st run of your Data:  
		
		In the data tab:
		  - Full analysis  
		  - select 1st func Run  file for your template subject as an inpu
		  - Choose your output directory  EX: run1_Template
		  
		In Regestration tab:
		  - check on Main structural image and place the anatomical image for your specified subject EX: sub-01_T1w.nii.gz 
		  - in both main structrual image and Standard space: 
		       - Change Normal Search to Full search 
		       - Change BBR to 12DOF 	

		In stats tab:
		  - click on Full model setup 
		  - change the number of original EVs to 2 
		  - in the 1 first tab: EV name -> incongruent
				        Basic Shape -> Custom (3 column format)
				        input file -> choose incongruent.txt file for your subject
				        Check on Add Temporal derivative & Uncheck on Apply Temporal Filtering
		  - Repeat the previous step for 2 but replace incongruent with congruent
		  - Go to Contrast&F-Tests: Contrasts -> 3
				            OC1 -> incongruent [1,0]
				            OC2 -> congruent [0,1]
				            OC3 -> incongruent-congruent [1,-1]
				            CLICK Done
		CLICK Save and all you'll have run1_Template files folder * we care about design_run1.fsf 
	4) Repeat the previous step for Run 2

After you prepare your design template for Both Run 1 & 2 , you will need to do the following:

	1) move design_run1.fsf , design_run2.fsf & run_1stLevel_Analysis.sh to your Data directory
	2) Finally, Run run_1stLevel_Analysis.sh file in the terminal using bash command
	YOU Can use Modified_1fsf.sh instead of run_1stLevel_Analysis.sh if you wish to have only one design file and loop over it :) 
	Note that it will take much time for the script to complete the 1st Level analysis on all the 26 subjects to , Be Patient!
	You can track the progress from the log HTML files
