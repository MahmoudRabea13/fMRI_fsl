# Steps to do ROI Analysis for all your 26 FLANKER Dataset subjects

At first , you will need to do 1st,2nd and 3rd level analysis before doing the ROI level analysis

Assuming you have done them level analysis , follow these steps to perform ROI level analysis:
	
A) Anatomical ROI

	1) Create your anatomical mask:
		-Open fsleyes and from standards open MNI152_T1_2mm.nii.gz
		- From settings ortho view, open atlases , harvard oxford cortical atlas
		- Choose paracingulate gyrus and save the template as PCG.nii.gz
	2) Merge all zstats of Cope3 by running the following command in 	
	   cope3.feat/stats      fslmerge -t allZstats.nii.gz `ls zstat* | sort -V

	3) Run the following command in order to get the means	
	fslmeants -i allZstats.nii.gz -m PCG.nii.gz

	4) Now do one sample t-test using R language to obtain the results


B) Spherical ROI Voxel location [0,20,44]

	1- Open MNI template in fsleyes  and get the voxel location.

	2- In the terminal go to the FLANKER directory and type the following which shall give you a centroid of these voxel locations:

	fslmaths $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm.nii.gz -mul 0 -add 1 -roi 45 1 73 1 58 1 0 1 Jahn_ROI_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz -odt float 

	3- Run the following command to expand this single voxel with specific raduis 5mm : 

	fslmaths Jahn_ROI_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz -kernel sphere 5 -fmean Jahn_Sphere_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz -odt float.


	4- Run the following command to binarize the results  :

	fslmaths Jahn_Sphere_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz -bin Jahn_Sphere_bin_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz 

	5- Get the means of this voxel location by running the following command   :
	 fslmeants -i allZstats.nii.gz -m Jahn_Sphere_bin_dmPFC_0_20_44.nii.gz

	6- Finally , do one sample t-test using R to get your results
