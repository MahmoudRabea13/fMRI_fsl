# Steps to do 2st Level Analysis for all your 26 FLANKER Dataset subjects

At first , you will need to do 1st level analysis before doing the second level analysis

Assuming you have done the 1st level analysis , follow these steps to perform 2nd level analysis:
	
	1) Open fsl using fsl command in your terminal then choose FEAT fMRI analysis  
	2) instead of choosing first level analysis , choose higher level analysis
	3) choose your 52 input fet directories
		instead of choose each fet manually , do wildcard selection by running the following command:
		ls -d$PWD/sub-??/func/run*
	4) choose your output directory 
	5) go to the stats tab:
		- choose fixed effect inference 
		- choose full model setup =>  - choose 26 EVs and average the two runs of each subject by placing 1 at only these specified 
		                                runs for this subject   EX => EV3 input5: 1.0 input6: 1.0 and the rest 0 
		 			      - go to contrast and select 26 contrasts and place 1 in only the main diagonal
	6)Click done and GO 

Note that 2nd level analysis is computationally expensive so , be patient.
